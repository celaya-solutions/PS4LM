# PS4LM

llama.cpp as a homebrew app on your own PS4. A small GGUF model runs on the
console's eight Jaguar CPU cores, and `llama-server` serves it to your home
network, so a browser on your Mac can chat with a model running on the PS4.

CPU only, one console, one interface. It follows the layout and fixes of
[PS5LM](https://github.com/cobanov/PS5LM), which does the same on a PS5.

## Status

Phase 1 (plumbing: send, logs, run, FTP upload). See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
Nothing here runs a model yet.

## What you need

- A PS4 you own, with a homebrew enabler (GoldHEN, HEN VTX or similar) already
  loaded. Enabling homebrew is your step, done with existing public tools
  before each session. This repo contains no jailbreak, exploit or kernel code.
- Tested target: firmware 11.02, base PS4, GoldHEN.
- An Apple Silicon Mac with Homebrew: `brew install llvm@18 cmake ninja socat wget`.

## Quick start

```sh
scripts/setup-sdk.sh                       # PS4 payload SDK + libc++ into ~/ps4dev/sdk
echo 'PS4_HOST=192.168.1.50' > scripts/env.local.sh   # your console's IP
source scripts/env.sh
make -C probes                             # build/probes/hello.elf, memprobe.elf

scripts/console-setup.sh                   # elfldr on 9021 (through GoldHEN's 9090)
scripts/logs.sh                            # in a second terminal
scripts/run.sh hello "two words"           # build, upload over FTP, run with args
scripts/run.sh memprobe
scripts/send.sh build/probes/hello.elf     # or send an ELF straight to elfldr
```

Settings live in `scripts/env.sh`. `PS4_LOADER_PORT` is the enabler's payload
port: 9090 for GoldHEN (the default), 9020 for HEN VTX.
